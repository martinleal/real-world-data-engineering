# real-world-data-pipelines

This repository showcases practical, production-level data pipelines and transformations based on real-world experience, carefully adapted to preserve confidentiality.  

Each example reflects optimizations, design patterns, and engineering decisions used in modern data platforms, particularly in Snowflake.

The goal is to share reusable ideas — not just code — including performance improvements, modular design, and SQL/data warehouse best practices.

## Contents

### 1. Optimized Fact Table ELT
A performance-optimized version of a fact table pipeline implemented in Snowflake.

**Key highlights:**
- Use of append-only `STREAMs` for incremental change tracking
- Use of deltas to detect changes on views, avoiding `STREAM` limitations
- Early flattening of semi-structured data
- Breaking down transformations into logical steps using temporary tables

**Folder contains:**
- `fact_table_deprecated_version/` – legacy version with performance issues
- `optimized_fact_table/` – modular version with ~70% performance improvement
